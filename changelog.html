      A open source proxy server is used to hit my medium rss link and get the
      rss post details details dynamically and showcase in my portfolio's
      <a href="index.html#my-blogs">my blogs</a> section.
      <h4 class="heading-lbrwn">19 Nov 2023</h4>
      <a href="blogs.html">Personal blog curation page</a> has been made
      dynamic. I have created a google form that writes to google sheets. I have
      exposed a get api from google sheets to return the form response. The blog
      page consumes the get api to produce dynamic content
      <h4 class="heading-lbrwn">26 Nov 2023</h4>
      Added animated loading to make the
      <a href="curationofblogs.html">curated blog</a> page more interesting.
